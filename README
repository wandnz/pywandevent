Pywandevent -  A handy event-handling environment used by a variety of
               software developed by the WAND Group at the University of
               Waikato, New Zealand.

This directory contains source code for pywandevent, a userspace library
that provides an API for developing event-driven python programs.

The primary idea behind the design of pywandevent is that the user program
will register an event, providing pywandevent with a function that is to
be called should that event occur. All of the code to deal with things such
as select(), timeouts and signal handling is contained within pywandevent,
leaving the programmer free to concentrate on the details of what their
program needs to do when the event occurs, rather than checking for the
occurence of the event.

Events can be registered on:
        file descriptors (read events, write events or both)
        timers (N seconds from the time the event was registered)
        signals (whenever signal X occurs)

We expect that most users of pywandevent are only installing it because it
is required to use some other piece of WAND software. However, if you wish
to use it yourself to develop event-driven programs, feel free to do so.
